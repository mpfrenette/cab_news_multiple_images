# cab_news_multiple_images
In TYPO3 tt_news, you can attach multiple images to a news article, but they all show up in the same place. I wrote this extension in March 2007 to allow putting individual images into the template, so that perhaps the 1st one is at the top, the 2nd at the bottom, the 3rd floated to the right, etc...
